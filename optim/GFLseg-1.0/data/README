Lung
A collection of 39 lung cancer cell lines, originally published in [1,2] and studied in [3]. We obtained these data from the CNA-HMMer package [4].

Bladder
A collection 57 array CGH profiles of bladder tumor samples, from [5]. Each sample is represented by 2143 probes along non-sexual chromosomes.
